# Image Based Biometry assignments


## Assignment 1

`awe` dataset: [download link](https://tinyurl.com/3ucw29ar)
TODO change link to dbox.si

Original LBP paper (Ojala et. al.): [download link](https://dbox.si/index.php/s/Yqd3Y34q4wxDjNd)


## Assignment 2

Data, pretrained cascades for Haar-cascades classifier, and pretrained model for YOLOv5: [download link](https://tinyurl.com/ibba2)

The requirement for Assignment 2 is YOLOv5. The GitHub repo is available [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). Since we are using PyTorch hub, it is not necessary to clone the repository, as stated in the documentation for loading YOLOv5 using PyTorch hub [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/36). As they stated, it is enough to install requirements using the command
```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/yolov5/master/requirements.txt
```
and then check under "Custom Models" to see how to load a custom model (as that is what we are using for assignment 2).
